This readme concerns the files in the Handheld_Evapotranspiration folder.
The ET_script_manuscript.py file is made to statistically proof the applicability of a Machine Learning method to calculate the evapotranspiration rate using a smartphone and a Weatherflow WEATHERmeter.
Data of the handheld devices are simple meteorological parameters such as air temperature, soil surface temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity and illuminance.
